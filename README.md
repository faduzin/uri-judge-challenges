## How to Use

1. **Choose a Problem**:
   - Each file is named after the problem number on the URI Online Judge platform.
   - Locate the problem number of interest, e.g., `1001.c`.

2. **Compile the Solution**:
   - Use the `gcc` compiler to compile the solution:
     ```bash
     gcc -o solution 1001.c
     ```
   - Replace `1001.c` with the desired file name.

3. **Run the Compiled Program**:
   ```bash
   ./solution
   ```

4. **Input and Output**:
   - Provide the required inputs as specified in the problem statement.
   - Verify the output matches the expected results.
